## 2. Keyword Performance & Opportunities

### Top Performers
| Keyword | Clicks | Impressions | CTR | Rank | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **bw converter** | 49 | 384 | 12.8% | 6.9 | Strongest term. Top 10 ranking secured. |
| **bwconverter** | 44 | 66 | 66.7% | 1.3 | Brand/Navigational. Users know the name. |

### High Potential (High Imp / Low Rank)
| Keyword | Impressions | CTR | Rank | Opportunity |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **black and white converter** | 1,509 | 1.1% | 24.3 | Huge volume. Moving from Page 3 to Page 1 could 10x traffic. |

| **convert image to black and white** | 1,255 | 0.4% | 47.8 | High intent, but ranking is poor. Content gap? |

## 3. Technical Issues: URL Cannibalization
The data reveals split ranking signals across duplicate URL variations. This dilutes authority.

- **Batch Converter Split:**
  - `https://bwconverter.com/batch`
  - `https://bwconverter.com/batch/`
  - `https://bwconverter.com/batch.html`
  - *Recommendation:* Canonicalize all to a single version (e.g., trailing slash) and 301 redirect the others.

- **Generic Landing Page Confusion:**
  - `https://bwconverter.com/black-and-white-image`
  - `https://bwconverter.com/black-and-white-image/`
  - `https://bwconverter.com/convert-image-to-black-and-white`
  - `https://bwconverter.com/convert-image-to-black-and-white.html`
  - *Status:* These pages have high impressions but near-zero clicks and rankings >70.
  - *Recommendation:* Consolidate these into one strong "Universal Converter" page or 301 them to Home if they offer no unique value.

## 4. Audience Insights
- **Device:** **Desktop** is dominant (73% of clicks). Ensure the desktop experience is premium. Mobile CTR is higher (2.1% vs 1.8%), so don't neglect it, but prioritize desktop tools.
- **Geography:**
  - **USA:** Top volume, but rank is weak (~31). Hardest market to crack.
  - **China:** High CTR (25%) on low volume - likely loyal users or brand searches.
  - **Europe (RO, IT, DE, FR):** Strong engagement signals.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Consolidate URLs:** Fix the `.html` and trailing slash inconsistencies immediately.
2.  **Target "Converter" Terms:** The homepage is ranking for broad terms. Update the H1 and Title on the homepage to explicitly target "Black and White Image Converter" to push it from rank 12 to top 3.
3.  **Create "Convert" Landing Page:** For "convert image to...", considering creating a dedicated, highly optimized landing page if the homepage is too generic.
